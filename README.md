# Dice-Game

Hi!! ðŸ˜ƒ

So I am exploring all this Python world and I am trying a couple of things to see how I get on. The ideia was to be a dice simulator but I was curious to see
what could I potencially do on a game like this, and this program can have multiple features which I pretend to add as soon as my knowledge is growing. ðŸ¤žðŸ˜Š

This is a simple program that asks the user for a number between 1 and 6, and again the program will ask for a number again, between 1 and 6 then the program 
calculates the sum of the two numbers selected by the user.

The program will generate a random integer number between 1 and 6. 

If the sum of the two numbers selected by the user are bigger than the number that randomnly was given to the dice(computer), the user wins and a happy message shows. 
If the computer wins the user, user will receive a message to actually try again beat the "dice", and of course they can have the same value and it will be a tie, and
a message will be displayed as well.
